# Fishbowl-Frenzy
3D printer files for the pegs that go into Fishbowl Frenzy

The peg prints with  hole in the middle of the bottom. This hole is for a nail 31.7mm long and 1.62mm wide. Or 1&1/4" long and 1/16" long. The hole in the peg is not that deep, however. The nail will need to be heated up and slid into the hole. This means that the end of the nail will melt into the peg, so it will not come out. Be sure to keep the plastic nuts from the original pegs, as I have not been able to successfully print the nut to fit the peg. However, if the nut is still needed, the thread on the ped is 1/4-20, so any 1/4-20 nut will work. Nylon works best. 

While regular PLA will work for the peg, Tough PLA seems to work better for it, as it appears to stick to itself better, and stay stuck to itself better as well.
